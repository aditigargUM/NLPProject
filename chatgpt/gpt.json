This process can be short or long and plays the biggest role in how long your cycle is. At the same time, the uterus starts growing a new endometrium to prepare for pregnancy.

So if you want to know how long YOUR dog will live, of course no one can know the future, but I can give you a pretty good idea....if you tell me a few things about your dog.",

However, the date of the spring equinox varies slightly from year to year. It can fall as early as 19th March or as late as 21st. Since spring (and other seasons) can begin on different days each year, it can be hard to compare seasons from year to year. To standardise the length and start of the seasons, in meteorology, the 12 months of the year have been split up into four, 3-month periods. Therefore, meteorological spring begins on 1 March every year and ends on 31 May, allowing weather forecasters to accurately make comparisons between different springs."
