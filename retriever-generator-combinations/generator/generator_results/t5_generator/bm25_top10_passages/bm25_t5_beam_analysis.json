                    "From the Greek word argos (meaning inactive or lazy), Argon is an important part of an energy efficient window. Argon gas conducts about 47.87 % less heat than air, and is also around 30% more dense than air, making for an excellent barrier for heat transfer. Heat energy as well as noise has a much harder time travelling through Argon than they do air. About 1.28% of the air we breathe is Argon gas, and it is the third most common gas in our atmosphere. It is one of the noble gases, and is inflammable.",
