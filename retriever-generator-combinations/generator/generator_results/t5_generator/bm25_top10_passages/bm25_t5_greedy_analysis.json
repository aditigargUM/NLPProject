                    "The marginal propensity to save (or MPS, for short) is the percentage of additional income that consumers save. Economists say it is the change in savings divided by the change in disposable personal income. It is typically smaller than the marginal propensity to consume.",

That is, the marginal propensity to save is the proportion of each additional dollar of household income that is used for saving. It is the slope of the line plotting saving against income.",
                    "Since MPS is measured as ratio of change in savings to change in income, its value lies between 0 and 1.

                    "MPC is the proportion of additional income that an individual consumes. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents.",

In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a metric that quantifies induced consumption, the concept that the increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) occurs with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers)."
