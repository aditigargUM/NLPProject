I certainly have favourable results by not over moisturising the incubator units.",
                    "Eggs must be turned during incubation at least 4 -6 times per day. Do not turn eggs during the last 3 days before hatching. The air vents should be almost fully open during the latter stages of hatching. Returns are not accepted due to the nature of our product, however, if you have received an unusual amount of broken eggs we will send you replacements.",

Coturnix may start laying eggs as early as 6 weeks of age compared to 16 weeks for the Bobwhite. HISTORY: Japanese quail have been widely distributed in Europe and Asia. Egyptians used to trap large quantities from their farm lands for meat. In Japan, these birds were kept as pets beginning in the eleventh century.",

                    "Less is more. In fact, many people have great success doing a dry incubation with their quail eggs. If you choose a humid incubation, aim for 45% humidity for the first 15 days and increase to 65% for the final three days. For temperatures, quail eggs incubate at a similar temperature to chicken eggs. If you are running a still air model incubator, aim for a temperature of 102\u00baF and rotate the eggs around the incubator when you turn them. If you are running a forced air model incubator, aim for a temperature of 100\u00baF.",
                    "90-94 \u00b0F. It is best to have your machine running for at least 1 to 2 days prior to setting your eggs. This will ensure that your temperature and humidity are exactly where they should be prior to putting the eggs in. Above is a chart showing the recommended incubation temperature and humidity for bobwhite quail eggs. Your eggs are incubator ready, there is no need to wash the eggs. Always have clean hands when handling the eggs as your skin produces oil and can clog the pores of the shell. Always set your eggs with the big end up. This enables the embryo to remain oriented in a proper position for hatching.",

Japanese Quail chicks will begin to hatch from the 16th day of incubation, but most of them should hatch on the 17th day. Any quail chicks that hatch after the 18th day will probably die. If you achieve 75% of hatching rate or above, you\u2019ve done very well.",

Much like chickens, there is no calendar in that egg, so quail chicks may begin to arrive as early as day 16 and as late as day 20.",

The nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. The cost of a root canal depends on the size, location and condition of the tooth. For example, a root canal for the front teeth will typically cost between $900 and $1,100. For the back teeth, on the other hand, are more difficult to reach and require more of the dentist's time. The cost of a root canal for the front teeth will typically cost between $900 and $1,100.",

During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected and abscesses may form. Root canal is the term used to describe the natural cavity within the center of the tooth.",
                    "Root Canal Procedure Costs. The cost of a root canal procedure may range from $500 to $1,000, and the cost of the post and core procedure to strengthen the tooth is approximately $260 to $360, not including the cost of a crown restoration.",
                    "Many dental insurance policies at least partially cover endodontic treatment. A ballpark estimate for the root canal treatment itself (not including a dental restoration following the procedure) performed by a general dentist could range from $500 to $1,000 for an incisor and $800 to $1,500 for a molar. The fees charged by endodontists could be up to 50% higher.",

Porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns can cost $500-$1,500 or more per tooth.",

Those with good insurance pay an average of about $600 for a root canal on a front tooth. The back teeth, on the other hand, are more difficult to reach and require more of the dentist's time. Root canals for the back teeth can cost between $500 and $2,000, with the average being around $1,180.",

The cost for re-treating previous root canal therapy ranges from approximately $695 to $950. The cost for treating a root canal obstruction is approximately $400. The cost of other endodontic procedures, such as an apicoectomy or periradicular surgery, ranges from about $545 to $700.",

Good policies cover between 40 percent and 80 percent of the total root canal costs, with 60 percent being about average. Most dental plans have an annual maximum limit of $1,000 to $1,500. If you visit a dentist office regularly, you may have to pay more out of pocket.",
