This allows them to be removed by scraping the skin where the cancer is with a curette (scraping device), leaving the surrounding non-cancerous skin intact. The area is then treated with an electric current to seal over blood vessels. The area may be treated with liquid nitrogen instead of the electric current.",

The technique is often performed by dermatologists, family physicians, and general surgeons in their offices on a daily basis. C&D was once a mainstay of treatment for basal cell and squamous cell cancers long before the laser skin surgical techniques used today.",
