The first thing to know is that pottery is a very old art form. It's been around for a very long time, and has been used in a lot of different ways. The oldest pottery we have is from the 16th century, and it's been used for a long time. The earliest pottery dates back to the 13th century. The pottery from the 14th century is a little older, but it's still used in some pottery styles. The most famous pottery style from the 15th and 16th centuries is that of the pottery wheel, which was invented in the late 15th century and is still used to this day. Pottery is made from clay, which is a type of clay that has a very high melting point, and a very low boiling point. This means that the clay is very hot, and when it boils, it turns to steam. This steam is what gives pottery its characteristic red color. When pottery was first invented, it was made with clay that was very hot and very dense.

The first thing to know is that pottery is a very old art form. It's been around for a very long time, and has been used in a lot of different ways. The oldest pottery we have is from the 16th century, and it's been used for a long time. The earliest pottery dates back to the 13th century. The pottery from the 14th century is a little older, but it's still used in some pottery styles. The most famous pottery style from the 15th and 16th centuries is that of the pottery wheel, which was invented in the late 15th century and is still used to this day. Pottery is made from clay, which is a type of clay that has a very high melting point, and a very low boiling point. This means that the clay is very hot, and when it boils, it turns to steam. This steam is what gives pottery its characteristic red color. When pottery was first invented, it was made with clay that was very hot and very dense.
